### Notes for later

- this app is a recipe meal planer that allows the user to save the recipes they like. As of now it is pulling from a 3rd part api for the recipe info. The user can see the recipes from the api in neat cards and can add them to their profile for viewing later, as well as deleting them from their profile as needed. In the future, the user will be able to press a next button to view more pages and they will be able to have an advanced search option for their needs.
